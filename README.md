# Windows XP Style Portfolio

This is a Windows XP style portfolio built using ReactJS. The design is inspired by the iconic operating system that many of us grew up using.

## Features

- This portfolio includes resizable and draggable windows, just like in Windows XP. You can resize any window by clicking and dragging the bottom-right corner, and move it around the screen by clicking and dragging the title bar.

## Inspiration

- Initially, I had planned to create a Windows 2000-inspired design, as that was my first encounter with a computer. However, I discovered that someone else had already done something similar, so I decided to switch gears and focus on Windows XP instead. This operating system was one that I spent a lot of time with and it's where I first learned about software, small Windows hacks, and other nifty tricks. While there may be other portfolios out there with a Windows XP theme, this one is my unique spin on it. I had wanted to create a Windows-themed portfolio for some time, and now that I have the skills to do so, I had a blast working on it.

## Node Packages Used

The following Node packages were used to build this portfolio:

### `@emailjs/browser`

This package is used to send emails directly from the browser. It provides a simple API for sending emails, and allows you to use your own email account to send them.

### `react-draggable`

This package is used to make the windows draggable, just like in Windows XP. You can click and drag the title bar of any window to move it around the screen.

### `react-iframe`

This package is used to embed external websites and web applications in iframes. This allows you to showcase your work and projects directly on your portfolio.
